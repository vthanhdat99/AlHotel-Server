## Technologies Used

-   [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
-   [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)
-   [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
-   [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/)

## Required Dependencies

-   `.NET 8.0.403 SDK`
-   `Entity Framework Core`
-   `Microsoft SQL Server 2022 - Express edition`
-   `Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - SSMS`

Make sure to have these installed before proceeding with the project setup.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues installing the `.NET runtime`, consider installing it through `Visual Studio`. Details are provided below.

## Installation

### Install `dotnet runtime` through `Visual Studio`

Follow these steps to download Visual Studio 2022 and dotnet runtime.

1. Download Visual Studio 2022:

    - Visit the [official Visual Studio 2022 download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
    - Choose the `Community` edition (free) or the version that suits your needs.
    - Click `Download` and follow the installation prompts.

2. Launch the Visual Studio Installer:

    - After downloading the installer, open it to start setting up Visual Studio.
    - You'll be prompted to select workloads to install.

3. Select the .NET Workloads and start the installation:

    - In the `Workloads` tab, find the section labeled `ASP.NET and web development`.
    - Check the box for `ASP.NET and web development` to install all necessary tools.
    - Click `Install` to download and install the selected features.

4. Verify .NET Runtime:

    - After the installation, you can verify the installed `.NET runtime` by opening a terminal and typing the following command:

        ```bash
        dotnet --version
        ```

    - It should return the version of the `.NET SDK` installed by Visual Studio.

### Cloning the project and install dependencies

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YGOhappy123/StayMateHotel-WebService.git
    ```

2. Change project name to `server` to avoid namespace conflicting **(Important)**:

    ```bash
    mv StayMateHotel-WebService server
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

## Before You Run

Before running the project, make sure to set up the database and environment variables:

1. Create a `appsettings.Development.json` file:

    In the root directory of your project (at the same level as `Program.cs`), create a `appsettings.Development.json` file.

2. Populate the environment variables:

    Copy the structure from `appsettings.Example.json` file into `appsettings.Development.json` and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

    **Notes:**

    - You must replace `<your_server_name>` with the actual value of your local Microsoft SQL Server instance.

    - Ensure that `StayMateHotel` (the database name) is correct, as the application uses migrations that depend on this database.

3. For collaborators:

    If you are a collaborator on this project, please contact the project owner to obtain the values for the environment variables.

4. Apply the migrations to create the necessary database tables. Use the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

    This command will apply the existing migrations to the specified database, ensuring that the required tables are created.

    **Note:** If you encounter any errors like `dotnet-ef: command not found`, install the `dotnet-ef` tool globally on your machine using the following command an retry:

    ```bash
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 8.0.10
    ```

5. Verify the created database:

    If you don't see a database name `StayMateHotel` in your SQL Server Management Studio after refreshing, try disconnecting and reconnecting your SQL Server.

## Development

To start the development server, use:

```bash
dotnet watch run
```

This will start the Dotnet development server

You can access the app by visiting `http://localhost:5000/api/v1` in your browser.

You can also replace `localhost` with your device's `IPv4 Address`, which can be found by entering the following command in the `terminal` and look for `Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi` > `IPv4 Address`:

```bash
ipconfig
```

## Connect Other Devices To This Server

**Requirement:** All devices must be connected to the same network.

Follow these steps to ensure that your firewall allows incoming connections on port 5000.

1. Open `Windows Defender Firewall`.
2. Click on `Advanced settings`.
3. Select `Inbound Rules` and then `New Rule`.
4. Choose `Port`, click `Next`.
5. Select `TCP` and enter `5000` in the specific local ports box.
6. Allow the connection and complete the wizard.

Now you can access the app using other devices by visiting `http://<IPv4 Adddess>:5000/api/v1`
